## Using Obsidian Plugin

OE Obsidian Plugin syncs the obsidian note to the Only Ever application. To sync the note metatag `oe_sync: true` is to be added to the frontmatter of notes that you wish to sync. The tag can by either one of the following process:

-   Add the manually to front matter.
-   Add the tag through the `Mark to Sync` button present on the ribbon
-   Add tag using your predefined hotkeys.

Once the `oe_sync:true` metatag is added to the frontmatter, the notes will be synced during the following processes:

-   when the notes are explictly saved
-   when obsidian application is initially loaded
-   on clicking the `Sync Notes` button present in the ribbon
-   using the predefined hotkey for sync.

To define hot keys for the obsidian plugin, please visit the Hotkeys tab of the setting. Search for the HotKeys with name 'Obsidian-Onlyever-Plugin', then set desired hotkeys to `Mark for Sync` and `Sync Notes` functionalities.
